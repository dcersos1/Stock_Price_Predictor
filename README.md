# Stock_Price_Predictor
Dan Cersosimo | Data Scientist | LSTM Neural Networks, ARIMA, and ETS

**Overview:**

This project works throuhj five years of time series data for five companies stock prices: Apple, PepsiCo, Amazon, Google, Barnes & Nobles. This data is acquired via Yahoo Finance and details a variety of past daily price metrics (opening, closing, high, etc.). From this, I determined the goals for the project with regards to the intention behind any analysis and modeling. This was to generate a 10 day forecast for a user specified company and price metric alongside a user interactive tool that predicts a hypotheitcal next days value based on input specifications. I employ three modeling techniques to execute this project: ETS, ARIMA, and LSTM Neural Networks


**How to Run:**

The project in its entiretyb can be viewed in the .ipynb file inside this repository. To run yourself, you must be able to run Jupyter Notebooks while importing and loading the necessary libraries and functions as detailed in the project.

For this project, I sought to work on a problem with strong real world implications. Stock Price fluctuations met this criteria and as millions of peoples profits are impacted daily as a result of these highly volatile variations.
